# The Ceili Tunebook Project
Paperless sheet music for traditional Celtic music

For details, see http://ceili.dyndns-wiki.com/. See also https://github.com/getdunne/Ceili-Tunebook-Android.

There are two distinct Python projects here:

1. "Flask Web App" is a web application, which allows uploading tune images and creating hierarchical "tunebooks".
2. "Python Client" is a [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/docs)-based client app, which is able to retrieve and cache tunebooks and tune images from the web, and allow these to be browsed/viewed locally on a PC or Raspberry Pi.
